	The mothod that I chose in creating the AST is one pretty intuitive, with 
two stacks (one for the operators and one for the intermediary sub-trees) which 
in the end one of them will contain the AST.
	Problems were many, from peeking an empty stack to thinking totally wrong
the implementation. I think that the most troubling issue was the unary minus;
i thought that I can deal with it without taking a special case, just for it.
I was wrong!
	Another issue was (and still is) the '^' operator, which I didn't really 
get it how it works. 
	After I have created the AST, I implemented the Visitor and Visitable 
interfaces and visited the tree, one node after another, which I think it was 
the easiest part of all the problem. :)
